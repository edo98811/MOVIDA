# UI Design:

# The renderUI blocks inside lapply are functional but could benefit from clearer separation of concerns. Consider extracting repetitive UI generation logic into helper functions.
# Performance:

# The lapply loops for generating UI and server logic are efficient but could benefit from caching or memoization if the data sources are large or computationally expensive.
